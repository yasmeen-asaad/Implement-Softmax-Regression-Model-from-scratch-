# Implement-Softmax-Regression-Model-from-scratch-
Implement and train Softmax Regression with mini-batch SGD and early stopping
Using numpy, pandas and sklearn for importing iris dataset 
Implement Softmax Regression Model.  <br>
Implement mini-batch SGD.  <br>
The training should support early stopping.  <br>
Train and evaluate the model with cross-validation. The evaluation metric is the accuracy.  <br>
Retrain the model with early stopping.  <br>
